        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>With the development of the mathematical power of the computer, the spacing for proportional fonts got easier, but monospaced fonts have continued to be popular than falling behind. In fact, it is now more widely being used for computer programming than proportional fonts because of few reasons. 
            <br><br>First of all, the alignment of the monospaced fonts make it easier to check the code. In detail, with the usage of proportional spacing font, the below two lines have the same number of characters, but their alignment does not match with one another. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <section class="example1">
            <p>lie = lie.variable()<br>
                con = con.variable()
                </p>
        </section>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Here, the tall characters are generally squeezed sideways until they resemble each other. Even though it is possible to add some space/tabs and try to align them, it is an unnecessary additional effort to do such, and it is merely impossible to get it just right which makes it the engineers hard to read code since the proportional fonts hold a different alignment.
            </p>

        <section class="example2">
            <h4>lie = lie.variable()<br>
                con = con.variable()
                </h4>
        </section>

        <section class="paragraph2">
            <p>Here, you can see the = operator in both statements is aligned vertically, and both lines end at the same cursor point with a monospaced font.</p>

        <section class="paragraph2">
            <p>The second reason why the monospaced font is preferred over the proportional font is because of the parentheses, punctuation, and negation(!). In addition to regular alphanumeric characters, the expressions (parentheses, punctuations [, ; .] are used as much as the alphanumeric characters. Similar to the first problem, these characters hold very thin/narrow in proportional fonts, which are also hard to read as they are small.             </p>

        <section class="paragraph3">
            <p>In this manner, those expressions on the monospaced font are more visible as it gives more space to those syntactical characters, while in the proportional font they are remained squeezed for better legibility on the text itself.

                First is Fira code that was designed by multiple designers, which is an extension of the Fira Mono font, and undoubtedly the most commonly used font for coding. Fira code contains multiple code-specific ligatures (which also includes ligature for ‘www’). Furthermore, Fira code has great legibility where it differentiates “1”, “l” and “I” characters to be clearly distinguishable.
